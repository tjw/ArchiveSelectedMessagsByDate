Install by placing in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail
 
You can then invoke a couple different ways:

- Open /Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app
- Open its preferences and enable the Show Script menu in menu bar
- This should put a menu extra on the right side of the menu bar that will have a "Archive Selected Messages by Date" option

Alternatively if you prefer a keyboard shortcut:

- Install FastScripts from https://redsweater.com/fastscripts/ and buy a license
- Open it up (it will also add a menu extra)
- Open its preferences
- In the General tab, set Open FastScripts when you log in to your Mac
- In the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, expand the Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail hierarchy and assign a shortcut. I used control-command-1k (though this replaces Mail's default Move to All Inboxes keyboard shortcut)

The second option is a little faster once you get your preferred keyboard shortcut memorized
